<p>There are situations when methods and classes do not depend on the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, a data type is a category that determines the type of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | Java has two groups of data types: primitive and reference types. Primitive data types are built-in and include eight types, such as int (integer number), float and double (fractional numbers), and boolean (true or false values). Reference types, on the other hand, are used to represent objects, and they are created using the keyword new. When a reference type is created, memory is allocated for the object, and it is called instantiation. Floating-point types, such as float and double, represent numbers that contain an integer part, a fractional part, and their separator, commonly used in fields such as science, statistics, and engineering.">data types</a> on which they operate. For example, the algorithm to find an element in an array can process arrays of strings, integers or custom classes. It does not matter what the array stores: the algorithm is always the same. Yet we cannot write this algorithm as a single method, because it requires different arguments (<code class="language-java">int[]</code>, <code class="language-java">String[]</code>, etc).</p>
<p>Since version 5, Java has supported <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, generic programming is a programming paradigm that allows for the creation of reusable code that can work with different data types. | It was introduced in Java 5 to implement generic programming and control type-safety at compile-time. The feature includes the use of type parameters, which are represented by a single uppercase letter, such as T, E, or K. When a program is translated into bytecode, the compiler erases the type information of the generic type, replacing it with its bound. This process, called type erasure, ensures that all objects of a generic class have the same type at runtime. Generic programming enables the parameterization of types when defining classes or interfaces and methods, allowing for the reuse of the same code while processing different concrete types.">generic programming</a> that introduces abstraction over types. <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, a generic method is a method that introduces its own type parameters, which can be used to declare the return type and the types of the method's parameters. | A generic method is not restricted by wildcards, which are used to implement an equivalent of inheritance in generics. Wildcards are declared with the '?' symbol and are often used with upper or lower bounds to restrict the type parameter. A generic method can take or return values of non-generic types as well. For example, a generic method can take a generic array and return its size as an integer. A generic method's body is declared like that of any other method. A generic method can be called with any reference type as an argument, such as an array of integers or an array of strings.">Generic methods</a> and classes can handle different types in the same general way.<strong> </strong>A concrete type is determined only when a developer creates an object of the class or invokes the method. This approach enables us to write more abstract code and develop reusable software libraries. Let us consider it step by step using examples written in Java.</p>
<h5 id="type-parameters" style="text-align: center;">Type parameters</h5>
<p>A generic type is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, a generic class is a class that is parameterized over a type, allowing it to handle different data types in a uniform manner. | The type parameter is specified within angle brackets following the class name, and it can be used within the class body for fields, method arguments, return values, and local variables. The concrete type is determined when an object of the class is created or a method is invoked. Only reference types, such as arrays, standard classes, or custom classes, can be used as concrete types for generic classes. This approach enables the writing of more abstract and reusable code, as the same class or method can process multiple types in the same way.">generic class</a> (or interface) that is parameterized over types. To declare a generic class, we need to declare a class with the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, a type parameter is a placeholder for a specific type used in a class or method declaration. | It is defined within angle brackets following the class or method name. Once declared, a type parameter can be used within the class or method body as an ordinary type. The advantage of using type parameters is that they enable you to write more abstract code and develop reusable software libraries. At the time of creating an object of the class or invoking the method, a concrete type is determined for the type parameter.">type parameter</a> section delimited by angle brackets <code class="language-java">&lt;</code> <code class="language-java">&gt;</code> following the class name.</p>
<p>In the following example, the class <code class="language-java">GenericType</code> has a single type parameter named <code class="language-java">T</code>. We assume that the type <code class="language-java">T</code> is "some type" and write the class body regardless of the concrete type.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class GenericType&lt;T&gt; { 

    /**
     * A field of "some type"
     */
    private T t;

    /**
     * Takes a value of "some type" and assigns it to the field
     */
    public GenericType(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    /**
     * Returns a value of "some type"
     */
    public T get() {
        return t;
    }

    /**
     * Takes a value of "some type", assigns it to a field and then returns it
     */
    public T set(T t) {
        this.t = t;
        return this.t;   
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>After being declared, a type parameter can be used inside the class body as an ordinary type. For instance, the above example uses the type parameter <code class="language-java">T</code> as: </p>
<ul>
<li>a type for a <em>field</em></li>
<li>a<em> constructor</em> argument type</li>
<li>an<em> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance method is a method that belongs to each object created of a particular class. | It can access fields of the specific object of the class. For example, if we have a class with two instance methods: method1() and method2(), and two objects: object1 and object2, the output of these methods will be different for each object because they have different values for the fields. To use an instance method, you must first create an object.">instance method</a></em> argument and return type</li>
</ul>
<p>The behavior of both instance methods does not depend on the concrete type of <code class="language-java">T</code>; it can take/return a string or a number in the same way.</p>
<p>A class can have any number of type parameters. For example, the following class has three.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Three&lt;T, U, V&gt; {
    T t;
    U u;
    V v;
}
</code></pre>
<p>But most generic classes have just one or two type parameters.</p>
<h5 id="the-naming-convention-for-type-parameters" style="text-align: center;">The naming convention for type parameters</h5>
<p>There is a naming convention that restricts type parameter name choices to single uppercase letters. Without this convention, it would be difficult to tell the difference between a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, a type variable is a type parameter that is declared in a class or method and is used to represent a concrete type that will be specified when an instance of the class or method is created. | Type variables are used for fields, method arguments, return values, and local variables within the class.

<p>The most commonly used type parameter names are:</p>

<h5 id="creating-objects-of-generic-classes" style="text-align: center;">Creating objects of generic classes</h5>
<p>To create an object of a generic class (standard or custom), we need to specify the type argument following the type name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">GenericType&lt;Integer&gt; obj1 = new GenericType&lt;Integer&gt;(10);

GenericType&lt;String&gt; obj2 = new GenericType&lt;String&gt;("abc");</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">It is important to note that a type argument must be a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, a reference type is a type of variable that stores a reference to an object located elsewhere in memory, rather than storing the object's value directly. | When an object is created using the new operator, it returns a reference to the location of the object in memory, allowing access to its fields and methods. Reference types can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. They are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java. Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object. When comparing reference types using the == operator, it compares the references (memory addresses) rather than the actual values. Additionally, assigning one value of a reference variable to another creates a copy of the reference, rather than the value itself. Reference types can also refer to a special value that represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or does not have a value. It is important to note that in Java, the heap is the region of memory where objects are stored and allocated dynamically during runtime.">reference type</a>. <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, a primitive type is one of eight built-in data types provided by the language. | They are represented by keywords and are not objects, unlike reference types. Primitive types are divided into groups based on their meaning, and each group operates similarly but has different sizes and ranges of value. The most commonly used primitive type is `int`, which represents an integer number. Java also provides several types for integer and fractional numbers, which are often used in arithmetic expressions. Primitive types store their value directly, unlike reference types that store a reference to an object located elsewhere.">Primitive types</a> like int or double are invalid type arguments.<strong> </strong></div>

<p>Java 7 made it possible to replace the type arguments required to invoke the constructor of a generic class with an empty set of type arguments, as long as the compiler can <em>infer </em>the type arguments from the context.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">GenericType&lt;Integer&gt; obj1 = new GenericType&lt;&gt;(10);

GenericType&lt;String&gt; obj2 = new GenericType&lt;&gt;("abc");</code></pre>
<p>We will use this format in all further examples.</p>

<p>Sometimes, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, a declaration is a statement that introduces a variable, method, or class into the program. | It specifies the type of the entity being declared, its name, and other relevant information such as access modifier, return type (for method), and initial value (for variable). For example, the declaration of a method may include its name, return type, access modifier, and parameter list. Declarations are essential for Java to understand the structure and behavior of the program. Incorrect declarations can lead to compilation errors. In the context of variables, a declaration specifies the type, name, and initial value of a variable. The type of a variable determines what possible operations can be performed on the variable and which value can be stored in it. Every variable has a name (also known as an identifier) to distinguish it from others. Before using a variable, it must be declared. The general form of a variable declaration is: `type identifier = value;`

It's important to note that a declaration is not the same as an assignment.">declaring</a> a variable with a generic type can be lengthy and difficult to read. Starting from Java 10, we can write <code class="language-java">var</code> instead of a specific type to force automatic <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, type inference is a feature that allows the compiler to automatically deduce the data type of a variable, expression, or method based on the context in which it is used. | This feature was introduced in Java 7, and it became more powerful in Java 10 with the introduction of the diamond operator (&lt;&gt;) and pattern matching. With type inference, developers can write more concise and readable code by avoiding explicit type declarations.">type inference</a> based on the type of assigned value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var obj3 = new GenericType&lt;&gt;("abc");</code></pre>
<p>After we have created an object with a specified type argument, we can invoke methods of the class that take or return the type parameter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Integer number = obj1.get(); // 10
String string = obj2.get();  // "abc"

System.out.println(obj1.set(20));    // prints the number 20
System.out.println(obj2.set("def")); // prints the string "def"</code></pre>
<p>If a class has multiple type parameters, we need to specify all of them when creating instances:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">GenericType&lt;Type1, Type2, ..., TypeN&gt; obj = new GenericType&lt;&gt;(...);</code></pre>
<h5 id="custom-generic-array" style="text-align: center;">Custom generic array</h5>
<p>As a more complicated example, let us consider the following class which represents a generic immutable array. It has one field to store items of type <code class="language-java">T</code>, a constructor to set items, a method to get an item by its index, and another method to get the length of the internal array. The class is immutable because it does not provide methods to modify the items array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class ImmutableArray&lt;T&gt; {

    private final T[] items;

    public ImmutableArray(T[] items) {
        this.items = items.clone();
    }

    public T get(int index) {
        return items[index];
    }

    public int length() {
        return items.length;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This class shows that a generic class can have methods (like length) that do not use the parameter type at all.</p>
<p>The following code creates an instance of <code class="language-java">ImmutableArray</code> to store three strings and then output the items to the standard output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var stringArray = new ImmutableArray&lt;&gt;(new String[] {"item1", "item2", "item3"});

for (int i = 0; i &lt; stringArray.length(); i++) {
    System.out.print(stringArray.get(i) + " ");
}</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to parameterize <code class="language-java">ImmutableArray</code> with any reference type, including arrays, standard classes, or your own classes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var doubleArray = new ImmutableArray&lt;&gt;(new Double[] {1.03, 2.04});

MyClass obj1 = ..., obj2 = ...; // suppose, you have two objects of your custom class

var array = new ImmutableArray&lt;&gt;(new MyClass[] {obj1, obj2});</code></pre>
<p>We used <code class="language-java">var</code> in the above examples to save space. Instead of using var, we could have explicitly specified the type, e.g. <code class="language-java">ImmutableArray&lt;String&gt; stringArray = ...;</code> and so on.</p>

<p>A class can declare one or more type parameters and use them inside the class body as types for fields, method arguments, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3492" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return value is the result that a method gives after executing its logic. | A method can return a value of a specific data type, or it can return no value, using the void keyword.
