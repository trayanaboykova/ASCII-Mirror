<p>As you know, <strong>generics</strong> enable us to parameterize types when defining classes (or interfaces) and methods. <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3493" target="_blank" title="In Java, a parameterized type is a type that is defined with a parameter enclosed in angle brackets, which is used to specify the type of data that the class or interface can handle. | This allows for the reuse of the same code while processing different concrete types.

<p>Let's consider a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3493" target="_blank" title="In Java, a generic class is a class that is parameterized over a type, allowing it to handle different data types in a uniform manner. | The type parameter is specified within angle brackets following the class name, and it can be used within the class body for fields, method arguments, return values, and local variables. The concrete type is determined when an object of the class is created or a method is invoked. Only reference types, such as arrays, standard classes, or custom classes, can be used as concrete types for generic classes. This approach enables the writing of more abstract and reusable code, as the same class or method can process multiple types in the same way.">generic class</a> named <code class="language-java">GenericType</code> that stores a value of "some type".</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class GenericType&lt;T&gt; { 

    private T t;

    public GenericType(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to create an object with a concrete type (e.g., <code class="language-java">String</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">GenericType&lt;String&gt; instance1 = new GenericType&lt;&gt;("abc");
String str = instance1.get();</code></pre>
<p>We can also create instances with other types (<code class="language-java">Integer</code>, <code class="language-java">Character</code>) and then invoke the <code class="language-java">get</code> method to access the internal field. In this manner, generics allow us to use the same class and methods for processing different types.</p>
<h5 id="reusing-code-with-object">Reusing code with Object</h5>
<p>But there is another way to reuse code. If we declare a field of type <code class="language-java">Object</code>, we can assign a value of any <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3493" target="_blank" title="In Java, a reference type is a type of variable that stores a reference to an object located elsewhere in memory, rather than storing the object's value directly. | When an object is created using the new operator, it returns a reference to the location of the object in memory, allowing access to its fields and methods. Reference types can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. They are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java. Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object. When comparing reference types using the == operator, it compares the references (memory addresses) rather than the actual values. Additionally, assigning one value of a reference variable to another creates a copy of the reference, rather than the value itself. Reference types can also refer to a special value that represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or does not have a value. It is important to note that in Java, the heap is the region of memory where objects are stored and allocated dynamically during runtime.">reference type</a> to it. This approach was widely used before the introduction of generics in<strong> </strong>Java 5.</p>
<p>The following class demonstrates this concept:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class NonGenericClass {

    private Object val;

    public NonGenericClass(Object val) {
        this.val = val;
    }

    public Object get() {
        return val;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we can create an instance of this class with the same string as in the previous example (see <code class="language-java">GenericType</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">NonGenericClass instance2 = new NonGenericClass("abc");</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to create an instance by passing in a value of type <code class="language-java">Integer</code>, <code class="language-java">Character</code>, or any other reference type.</p>
<p>Using the <code class="language-java">Object</code> class this way allows us to reuse the same class to store different <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3493" target="_blank" title="In Java, a data type is a category that determines the type of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | Java has two groups of data types: primitive and reference types. Primitive data types are built-in and include eight types, such as int (integer number), float and double (fractional numbers), and boolean (true or false values). Reference types, on the other hand, are used to represent objects, and they are created using the keyword new. When a reference type is created, memory is allocated for the object, and it is called instantiation. Floating-point types, such as float and double, represent numbers that contain an integer part, a fractional part, and their separator, commonly used in fields such as science, statistics, and engineering.">data types</a>.</p>
<h5 id="the-advantage-of-generics-from-run-time-to-compile-time">The advantage of generics: from run-time to compile-time</h5>
<p>After an invocation of the <code class="language-java">get()</code> method we obtain an <code class="language-java">Object</code>, not a <code class="language-java">String</code> or an <code class="language-java">Integer</code>. We cannot get a string directly from the method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">NonGenericClass instance2 = new NonGenericClass("abc");
String str = instance2.get(); // Compile-time error: Incompatible types</code></pre>
<p>To get the string back, we must perform an explicit typecast to the <code class="language-java">String</code> class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String str = (String) instance2.get(); // "abc"</code></pre>
<p>This works because a string was passed into <code class="language-java">instance2</code>. But what if the instance does not store a string? If this is the case, the code throws an exception. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">NonGenericClass instance3 = new NonGenericClass(123);
String str = (String) instance3.get(); // throws java.lang.ClassCastException</code></pre>
<p>Now we can see the main advantage of generics over the <code class="language-java">Object</code> class. Because there is no need to perform an explicit typecast, we never get a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3493" target="_blank" title="In Java, a runtime exception is an exception that occurs during the execution of a program, as opposed to a compile-time error. | These exceptions are caused by errors in the code that do not prevent the program from running, but will cause the program to crash when it encounters a broken line of code - a line containing an error.

When a runtime exception is thrown, the Java runtime system attempts to find a suitable handler for it, which can be located in the same method where the exception occurred or in a calling method.">runtime exception</a>. If we do something wrong, we can see it at compile time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">GenericType&lt;String&gt; instance4 = new GenericType&lt;&gt;("abc");

<h5 id="generics-without-specifying-a-type-of-argument">Generics without specifying a type of argument</h5>
<p>When you create an instance of a generic class, you have the option to not specify an argument type at all.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">GenericType instance5 = new GenericType("my-string");
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the field of the class is <code class="language-java">Object</code>, and the <code class="language-java">get</code> method returns an <code class="language-java">Object</code> as well.</p>
<p>The above code is equivalent to the following line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">GenericType&lt;Object&gt; instance5 = new GenericType&lt;&gt;("abc"); // it is parameterized with Object
</code></pre>
<p>Usually, you will not use generics parameterized by <code class="language-java">Object</code> due to the same problems as presented above. Just remember that this possibility exists.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Both generics and Objects allow you to write generalized code. Using <code class="language-java">Object</code>, however, may require explicit typecasting, which can lead to error-prone code.
