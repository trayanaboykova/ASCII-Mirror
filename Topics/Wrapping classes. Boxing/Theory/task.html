<p>Each <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3595" target="_blank" title="In Java, a primitive type is one of eight built-in data types provided by the language. | They are represented by keywords and are not objects, unlike reference types. Primitive types are divided into groups based on their meaning, and each group operates similarly but has different sizes and ranges of value. The most commonly used primitive type is `int`, which represents an integer number. Java also provides several types for integer and fractional numbers, which are often used in arithmetic expressions. Primitive types store their value directly, unlike reference types that store a reference to an object located elsewhere.">primitive type</a> has a class dedicated to it. These classes are known as <strong>wrappers</strong> and they are <strong>immutable</strong> (just like strings). <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3595" target="_blank" title="In Java, a wrapper class is a class that encapsulates a primitive type in an object. | There are eight wrapper classes in Java, one for each primitive type: Integer for int, Double for double, Character for char, and so on. Wrapper classes are immutable and can be used in situations where objects are required instead of primitive types. Boxing is the process of converting a primitive type to an object of the corresponding wrapper class, while unboxing is the reverse process. Autoboxing and auto-unboxing are automatic conversions performed by the Java compiler between primitive types and wrapper classes.">Wrapper classes</a> can be used in different situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a variable can be <code class="language-java">null</code> (absence of a value);</li>
<li>when you need to store values in generic collections (will be considered in the next topics);</li>
<li>when you want to use special methods of these classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table lists all primitive types and the corresponding wrapper classes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The table with primitive types and the corresponding wrappers</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, Java provides eight wrapper classes: one for each primitive type. The third column shows the type of argument you need so that you can create an object of the corresponding wrapper class.</p>
<h5 id="boxing-and-unboxing">Boxing and unboxing</h5>
<p><strong>Boxing</strong> is the conversion of primitive types to objects of corresponding wrapper classes.<strong> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3595" target="_blank" title="In Java, unboxing is the process of converting an object of a wrapper class (which contains a primitive value) back into its corresponding primitive type. | This conversion can occur automatically through a process called auto-unboxing, which is performed by the Java compiler. Unboxing is the reverse process of autoboxing, which converts a primitive type to an object of the corresponding wrapper class. Unboxing can result in a NullPointerException (NPE) if the wrapper object being unboxed is null.">Unboxing</a></strong> is the reverse process. The following code illustrates both processes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int primitive = 100;
Integer reference = Integer.valueOf(primitive); // boxing
int anotherPrimitive = reference.intValue();    // unboxing</code></pre>
<p><strong>Autoboxing </strong>and<strong> auto-unboxing</strong> are automatic conversions performed by the Java compiler.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double primitiveDouble = 10.8;
Double wrapperDouble = primitiveDouble; // autoboxing
double anotherPrimitiveDouble = wrapperDouble; // auto-unboxing</code></pre>
<p>You can mix both automatic and manual boxing/unboxing processes in your programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Autoboxing works only when the left and the right parts of an assignment have the same type. In other cases, you will get a compilation error.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Long n1 = 10L; // OK, assigning long to Long
Integer n2 = 10; // OK, assigning int to Integer 

Long n3 = 10; // WRONG, assigning int to Long
Integer n4 = 10L; // WRONG, assigning long to Integer</code></pre>
<h5 id="constructing-wrappers-based-on-other-types">Constructing wrappers based on other types</h5>
<p>The wrapper classes have constructors for creating objects from other types. For instance, an object of a wrapper class can be created from a string (except for the <code class="language-java">Character</code> class).</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Integer number = new Integer("10012"); // an Integer from "10012"
Float f = new Float("0.01");           // a Float from "0.01"
Long longNumber = new Long("100000000"); // a Long from "100000000"
Boolean boolVal = new Boolean("true");   // a Boolean from "true"</code></pre>
<p>You can also create wrapper objects using special methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Long longVal = Long.parseLong("1000");      // a Long from "1000"
Long anotherLongVal = Long.valueOf("2000"); // a Long from "2000"</code></pre>
<p>If the input string has an invalid argument (for instance, <code class="language-java">"1d0o3"</code>), both of these methods throw the <code class="language-java">NumberFormatException</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note, since Java 9, the constructors are deprecated. You should use the available special methods to create objects of the wrapper classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
</ul>
<h5 id="comparing-wrappers">Comparing wrappers</h5>
<p>Just like for any reference type, the operator <code class="language-java">==</code> checks whether two wrapper objects are actually equal, i.e. if they refer to the same object in memory. The method <code class="language-java">equals</code> , on the other hand, checks whether two wrapper objects are meaningfully equal, for example, it checks if two wrappers or strings have the same value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Long i1 = Long.valueOf("2000");
Long i2 = Long.valueOf("2000");
System.out.println(i1 == i2);      // false
System.out.println(i1.equals(i2)); // true</code></pre>
<p>Do not forget about this feature when working with wrappers. Even though they correspond to primitive types, wrapper objects are reference types!</p>
<h5 id="npe-when-unboxing">NPE when unboxing</h5>
<p>There is one possible problem when unboxing. If the wrapper object is <code class="language-java">null</code>, the unboxing throws a<strong> </strong><code class="language-java">NullPointerException</code><strong>.</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Long longVal = null;
long primitiveLong = longVal; // It throws an NPE</code></pre>
<p>To fix it, we can add a conditional statement that produces a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3595" target="_blank" title="In Java, a default value is a value that is automatically assigned to a variable, field, or array element if no explicit initial value is provided. | For example, an array of a primitive type is initialized with default values. Variables of type boolean are initialized to false, while numeric types are initialized to zero. For object reference types, the default value is null. When creating an object of a class, if no constructor is defined, the compiler automatically provides a default no-argument constructor that initializes all fields with their default values. However, if a specific constructor is defined, the default constructor will not be created.">default value</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">long unboxed = val != null ? val : 0; // No NPE here</code></pre>
<p>This code does not throw an exception.</p>
<p>Another example is <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3595" target="_blank" title="In Java, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations that can be performed using arithmetic operators. | These operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulus or remainder (%) operators. Arithmetic operations take two values or operands, with the exception of unary operators such as unary plus (+) and unary minus (-), which take a single value. The order of operation follows the standard arithmetic rules, with multiplication and division having a higher priority level than addition and subtraction. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and for clarity. The unary plus operator indicates a positive value, while the unary minus operator negates a value or an expression.">arithmetic operations</a> on <code class="language-java">Integer</code>, <code class="language-java">Long</code>, <code class="language-java">Double</code> and other numeric wrapper types. They may cause an <strong>NPE</strong> since auto-unboxing is involved.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Integer n1 = 50;
Integer n2 = null;
Integer result = n1 / n2; // It throws an NPE</code></pre>
<h5 id="primitive-types-vs-wrapper-classes">Primitive types vs. wrapper classes</h5>
<p>In this topic, we've taken a look at wrapper classes for primitive <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3595" target="_blank" title="In Java, a data type is a category that determines the type of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | Java has two groups of data types: primitive and reference types. Primitive data types are built-in and include eight types, such as int (integer number), float and double (fractional numbers), and boolean (true or false values). Reference types, on the other hand, are used to represent objects, and they are created using the keyword new. When a reference type is created, memory is allocated for the object, and it is called instantiation. Floating-point types, such as float and double, represent numbers that contain an integer part, a fractional part, and their separator, commonly used in fields such as science, statistics, and engineering.">data types</a>. Wrapper classes allow us to represent primitive types as objects, that are reference data types.</p>
<p>Here are some important points to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>processing values of primitive types is faster than processing wrapper objects;</li>
<li>wrappers can be used when you need <code class="language-java">null</code> as a no-value indicator;</li>
<li>primitive types cannot be used in standard collections (like lists, sets, or others), but wrappers can.</li>
</ul>
